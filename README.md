# 1 to 12 Dice-Roller
Roll between 1 and 12 dice using this single class GUI application.

Built June 2021 using IntelliJ 2020.2, JavaFX, and Java 14, although you could use down to Java 11 as you need lambda functionality.

Before launching, go to Project Settings -> Libraries and add the images folder to allow the application to find the correct path to the images.

Dice images were designed by: Icons made by Freepik and www.flaticon.com.
